title: 'Writing TinyKV: A Key Value Store in C++'
---

**TODO:**

1. Motivation
2. Architecture (LSM-Tree Key Value Store)
3. Components and the role they play
4. Future features (actual memory management / benchmarking and optimization - when is the “right” time to bench and optimize? /  concurrency handling / making it distributed)
5. SSTable disk layout (Part II: Implementation Details)
6. Memory management (Part II: Implementation Details)
7. Iterators (Part II: Implementation Details)
